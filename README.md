## Key Projects

- **Carbon Nanomaterial Phase Identification with Machine Vision** | Transfer Learning, Machine Vision, Scanning Electron Microscopy\
  [GitHub](https://github.com/dem0nsl4yer/Carbon_Nanomaterial_Phase_Identification)\
  This repository contains code and resources for the model presented in the paper "Leveraging Transfer Learning and Machine Vision for Enhanced Carbon Nanomaterial Phase Identification with Scanning Electron Microscopy." The model is designed to identify different carbon nanomaterial phases using transfer learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Researchers and practitioners can utilize the model to perform phase identification of carbon nanomaterials from SEM images. The provided code demonstrates how to load the pre-trained model, preprocess SEM images, and obtain accurate predictions for different carbon phases. This work is peer-reviewed and published here: https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16155426

- **Calorie counter** | Transfer Learning, InceptionV3, ImageNet, Python\
  [GitHub](https://github.com/dem0nsl4yer/Calorie_counter)\
  Developed a deep learning model using transfer learning with InceptionV3 architecture and pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset. Fine-tuned the model to classify 101 types of foods and accurately estimate their calorie content per gram. Employed data augmentation and advanced regularization techniques for improved generalization. Achieved exceptional results with 95% classification accuracy and precise calorie per gram intake estimation. Implemented an interactive web interface for a user-friendly experience.

- **Robo Collision Detector** | PyTorch, Pygame, Feed-forward Neural Network\
  [GitHub](https://github.com/dem0nsl4yer/robo_collision_detector)\
  Trained a PyTorch-based neural network for a robot collision detector. Captured data from random agent movement to prepare the environment. Designed a feed-forward neural network with two hidden layers of 40x40 neurons, utilizing ReLU activation for the hidden layers and sigmoid for the output. Optimized the network using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a small batch size of 16 activities. Achieved accurate collision detection by analyzing TP, TN, FP, and FN using the confusion matrix.

- **BetterFoods website** | Flask, Python, API Integration\
  [GitHub](https://github.com/dem0nsl4yer/Better_Foods)\
  Developed a user-friendly Flask website that utilizes APIs like YELP and Google Maps for seamless restaurant discovery based on ratings and proximity. Integrated the APIs to fetch real-time data, enabling accurate recommendations. Employed SQL databases for efficient data storage and retrieval. Implemented intricate backend logic and contributed to the GitHub repository for collaborative development.
